# Python Solutions for GeeksforGeeks Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to Python exercises from GeeksforGeeks (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-exercises-practice-questions-and-solutions/).

## Motivation

I created this repository to:

* Keep track of my progress and revisit problems and solutions later.
* Help others who are struggling with the same exercises.
* Showcase my Python skills and problem-solving abilities.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topic/category (e.g., Lists, Strings, Dictionaries) with each problem in its own Python file. Each solution includes:

* **Clear and concise code:**  Well-formatted and easy to understand.
* **Detailed comments:** Explaining the logic and approach.
* **Test cases (where applicable):** Demonstrating the solution's correctness.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`
2. **Navigate to the relevant directory:**  e.g., `cd Lists`
3. **Open the Python file:** e.g., `find_largest_element_in_list.py`
